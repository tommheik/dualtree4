## 4D dual-tree complex wavelet transform for Matlab

This is the repository for Matlab implementation of **4D** (4 dimensional) **dual-tree complex wavelet transform** and the corresponding **inverse transform** by Tommi Heikkil√§ (University of Helsinki, Department of Mathematics and Statistics).

Dual-tree complex wavelets introduced by N.G. Kingsbury and later further developed by I.W. Selesnick, R.G. Baraniuk and N.G. Kingsbury in 
"The dual-tree complex wavelet transform." *IEEE signal processing magazine 22.6 (2005): 123-151.* including 2D Matlab implementation.

Further extended to 3D by H. Chen and N.G. Kingsbury in 
"Efficient registration of nonrigid 3-d bodies." *IEEE transactions on image processing 21.1 (2011): 262-272.* including 3D Matlab implementation. This 3D implementation is also the basis on which the 4D extension is built.

Conference proceeding of our (T.A. Bubba, T.H., S. Siltanen) extension to 4D and some applications to dynamic tomography in
"4D Dual-Tree Complex Wavelets for Time-Dependent Data" *2021 21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA), 2021, pp. 146-156, doi: 10.1109/ICCSA54496.2021.00029.*

### Requirements

Just like the lower dimensional **dualtree** implementations (which are included in Wavelet Toolbox) these functions require the Matlab's [Wavelet Toolbox](https://se.mathworks.com/products/wavelet.html) to work properly!
